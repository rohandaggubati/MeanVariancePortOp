# MeanVariancePortOp
Portfolio Optimization Model using Simple Mean Variance Analysis

Process:
  I used Jupyter Notebook to build this. It makes it very simple, intuitive, and responsive. I have included the ipynb file as well as the executable script.

Sections:
  Broadly, there are 8 steps -
    1. Data Retrieval
    2. Data Preprocessing
    3. Calculating Expected Returns and Covariance Matrix
    4. Portfolio Optimization using Mean-Variance Optimization
    5. Incorporating Constraints and Extensions
    6. Optimization with CVXPY
    7. Analyzing and Visualizing the Results
    8. Backtesting the Optimized Portfolio
